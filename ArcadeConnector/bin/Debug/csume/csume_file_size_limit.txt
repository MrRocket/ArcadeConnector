I wasn't able to upload csume.exe here due to githubs project file size limits being less than 25mb.

You'll have to download the release manually here:
https://github.com/MrRocket/ArcadeConnector/releases/download/v1.0.1/ArcadeConnector.zip

All that should be needed is the csume.exe. you can either extract the full package or 
copy and paste the csume.exe from the archive to this location. eg ..\csume folder.
